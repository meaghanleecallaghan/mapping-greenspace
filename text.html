	<h1> Access to Quality Green Space May Contribute to Better Health, Wellness</h1>
	<h4>Lower rates of asthma, higher cognitive ability and better mental health could all be positive benefits of living near a local park, according to the increasing number of studies conducted studying health and wellness relations to green space. </h4>
	<p>Whether it is an official park maintained by the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation or a local vacant lot turned into community garden, nature surrounding the places people live, work and play have always been assumed to grant positive benefits. But, with this new research, a familiar theme is coming to the forefront -- more often than not, the rich have more access to green spaces. As the inequality gap widens, New Yorkers have not been left behind in the parks divide, though efforts to improve and create quality green spaces in low-income areas continue to crop up. 
	<p>Dr. Payam Dadvand, with the Center for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain, was part of a team researching green spaces' affects on children's cognitive abiity. While Dadvand and his team found a positive correlation, he noted that controling for the children's socioeconomic background was essential to the study. "It can be a very strong confounder as it is associated with both exposer to green spaces, i.e. rich are more likely to live in greener homes and/or greener neighborhoods, and health status, i.e. the rich are more likely to have a better health status," Davand said in an email.</p>
	<p>NYC is no different. Though more studies are needed to address the economic divide and access to green space and its benefits, you can view these maps, below. On the left is the median household income of zip codes in New York City. On the right is the parks and green spaces listed by the city.</p>
